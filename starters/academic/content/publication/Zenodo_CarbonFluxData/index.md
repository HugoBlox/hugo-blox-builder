# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'The data consists of the following:

1) Site-scale carbon flux data for an IARI experimental wheat site for the growing season 2013–2014 in New Delhi (28°40' N, 77°12' E).
2) The simulation data in NetCDF format comprises carbon fluxes such as GPP, NPP, Ra, Rh, and NEE.
3) Harvested wheat area of spring wheat across the Indian wheat-growing regions.
4) Site-scale NEP (gC/m2/mon) measured at Meerut (29°05′33″N, 77°41′53″E; growing season 2009-2010) and Saharanpur (29° 52′ 19.139″ N and   
   077° 34′ 01.621″ E; growing season 2014-15) extracted from published work (Patel et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2021, respectively)'
