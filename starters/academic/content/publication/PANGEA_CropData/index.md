# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'The site scale observations of the Indian crops are very rarely available for public access. Students at all agricultural institutes across India carry out experiments on Indian crops as part of their curriculum and report the results in thesis. The thesis from such institutes is uploaded to the Krishikosh repository (https://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in). To fill the gap of absence of crop data on Indian crops, we started to look at this repository and collect data. We have collected crop phenology and agricultural management data of major Indian crops spring wheat and rice from the thesis. In the current dataset we are providing the site scale experiments and results of rice crop. We are reporting data at 11 sites, a few of which have multiple growing seasons, therefore in total we have 26 datasets.'
