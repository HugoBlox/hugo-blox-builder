abstract: 'Croplands are one of the most common types of land use. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of land-atmosphere interactions requires an understanding of the biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes and interactions in agroecosystems. Croplands have not received adequate attention in ESMs and were previously represented as grasslands. Land components in ESMs, such as the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5), have recently begun to include specific crops. The addition of crops to land models improved the simulation of energy, carbon, and water fluxes from land. However, there are significant errors in crop representation for the Indian region, including cropping areas, cropping season, irrigation, and crop characteristics. CLM5's estimated annual yield of wheat and rice has significant biases compared to UN-FAO estimates due to differences in growing seasons. Furthermore, observational data on the phenology of spring wheat and rice are scarce in the Indian region. As a result, crop growth model simulations in the Indian region suffer from poor calibration and validation. The current study aims to improve CLM5's representation of spring wheat and rice crops. This is accomplished by incorporating a crop planting window based on observations, wheat and rice cultivated areas, and irrigated cropland maps from district-level data. To further improve the crop models, we digitized historical crop phenology data and used it for model calibration and validation. Correcting the spring wheat and rice growing seasons in CLM5 over India has greatly improved crop phenology, yield, and irrigation patterns. As a result, the energy, carbon, and water fluxes are better estimated than in the default CLM5 model.'
