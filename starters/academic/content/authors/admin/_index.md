I am a research scholar at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. My primary research interests include land surface modeling, crop modeling, and associated surface fluxes. I also have expertise in wind farm layout optimization using machine learning. I am part of the IIT Delhi team of the ISRO-IITD Geosphere-Biosphere Program (GBP), which aims to improve the CLM5 land surface model to simulate Indian agroecosystems accurately.
