title: Cricket
summary: 'I was always an avid cricket player. Throughout my education, I was part of the school teams. The most decorated and the one I am proud to be part of is the IIT Delhi Cricket team (which I have captained too...). I love to analyze my game and improve using the stats. Here is a glimpse of my cricket career'
