title: Wind Farm Layout Optimization
summary: Wind Farm Layout Optimization Problem (WFLOP) is a critical issue when installing a large wind farm. In this project, we used the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the WFLOP for large hypothetical offshore wind farms using real wind data. The study site is the Palk Strait, located between India and Sri Lanka. This site is a potential hotspot of offshore wind in India.
