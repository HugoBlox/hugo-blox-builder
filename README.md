[![Writing technical content](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/img/docs/writing-technical-content.gif)](https://academic-demo.netlify.apppost/writing-technical-content/)

## Ecosystem

* **[Academic Admin](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-admin):** An admin tool to import publications from BibTeX or import assets for an offline site
* **[Academic Scripts](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-scripts):** Scripts to help migrate content to new versions of Academic

## Create your site

You can choose from one of the following four methods to install:

* **one-minute Github/Gitlab install using your web browser (recommended)**
* install on your computer using Git with the Command Prompt/Terminal app
* install on your computer by downloading the ZIP files
* install on your computer with RStudio

### Create your site with GitHub

[**Create your site now with GitHub** :rocket:](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/)

### Create your site on your computer with Git

Prerequisites:

* [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Download and install Hugo Extended v0.73-v0.74](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)

Install:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart#fork-destination-box) the *Academic Kickstart* repository to create a new website
   * If you already created your site with **Netlify**, then skip this step
2. Clone your fork to your computer with Git, replacing `sourcethemes` in the command below with your GitHub username: 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website
    ```
    
3. Initialize the theme:

    ```bash
    cd My_Website
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

### Create your site on your computer _without_ Git

Prerequisites:

* [Download and install Hugo Extended v0.73-v0.74](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)

Install:

1. [Download](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart/archive/master.zip) and extract *Academic Kickstart*
2. [Download](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/archive/master.zip) and extract the *Academic theme* files from the `hugo-academic-master` folder to the `themes/academic/` folder in *Academic Kickstart*

### Create your site with RStudio

[Install Academic with RStudio](http://localhost:59000/academic/docs/install-locally/#install-with-rstudio)

## Demo content

For inspiration, refer to the [Markdown content](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite) which powers the [Demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.app).

If you wish to initialise your site with the demo content, copy the contents of the `themes/academic/exampleSite/` folder to your website root folder, overwriting existing files if necessary. The `exampleSite` folder contains an example config file and content to help you get started. The following command can be used to accomplish this:

```bash
cp -av themes/academic/exampleSite/* .
```
