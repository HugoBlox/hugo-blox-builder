### Install with web browser

[**Create your site now with Netlify** :rocket:](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart)

* One-click install of Academic creates an `academic-kickstart` repository in your GitHub or GitLab account
* Netlify will provide you with a customizable URL to access your new site, [or get your own domain](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/domain/)
* Around 1-5 minutes after editing content in your repository, your site will automatically update
  - If your site fails to update, [login to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), click your site, go to **Deploys**, and review the latest deploy log for any errors
* To **easily edit your site in a rich online editor in your browser**,
  - [Login to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and click the site you deployed with Netlify
  - Go to **Settings > Identity**, and select **Enable Identity** service
  - Under **Registration** preferences, select **Invite Only**
  - Scroll down to **Services > Git Gateway**, and click **Enable Git Gateway**
  - Head over to **`YOUR_SITE.com/admin/`** to view your content management panel and begin publishing content
  - For support with _Netlify CMS_ admin panel, refer to the [Netlify CMS docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication) and the very active [Netlify CMS community](https://www.netlifycms.org/community/)

Once you have followed the link above to automatically install Academic, head on over to your new `academic-kickstart` repository in your GitHub (or GitLab) account and [personalize your site by editing the files in](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/get-started/) `config/_default/`. Shortly after saving (i.e. *committing* a file), your site will automatically update.
