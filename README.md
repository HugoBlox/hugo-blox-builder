### Install with Git

Prerequisites:

* [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Download and install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)

       git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website
    
    *Note that if you forked Academic Kickstart, the above command should be edited to clone your fork, i.e. replace `sourcethemes` with your GitHub username.*

## Quick start

       hugo server

    Now visit [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and your new Academic powered website will appear. Otherwise, if using Netlify, they will provide you with your URL.

3. Build your site by running the `hugo` command. Then [host it for free using Github Pages](https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/) or Netlify (refer to the first installation method). Alternatively, copy the generated `public/` directory (by FTP, Rsync, etc.) to your production web server (such as a university's hosting service).

## Updating

Feel free to *star* the project on [Github](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/) to help keep track of updates and check out the [release notes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/updates) prior to updating your site.

Before updating the framework, it is recommended to make a backup of your entire website directory (or at least your `themes/academic` directory) and record your current version number.

By default, Academic is installed as a Git submodule which can be updated by running the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
