### Quick install using your web browser

    * Netlify will provide you with a customizable URL to access your new site

3. Read the [Quick Start Guide](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/) to learn how to add Markdown content. For inspiration, refer to the [Markdown content](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite) which powers the [Demo](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/)

### Install with Git

Prerequisites:

* [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Download and install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)

1. [Fork](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart#fork-destination-box) the *Academic Kickstart* repository and clone your fork with Git: 

        git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website
    
    *Note that if you forked Academic Kickstart, the above command should be edited to clone your fork, i.e. replace `sourcethemes` with your GitHub username.*

2. Initialize the theme:

        cd My_Website
        git submodule update --init --recursive

### Install with ZIP

1. [Download](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart/archive/master.zip) and extract *Academic Kickstart*
2. [Download](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/archive/master.zip) and extract the *Academic theme* to the `themes/academic/` folder from the above step

### Install with RStudio

[View the guide to installing Academic with RStudio](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/#install-with-rstudio)

## Quick start

1. If you installed on your computer, view your new website by running the following command:
      
        hugo server

    Now visit [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and your new Academic powered website will appear. Otherwise, if using Netlify, they will provide you with your URL.
           
2. Read the [Quick Start Guide](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/) to learn how to add Markdown content, customize your site, and deploy it. For inspiration, refer to the [Markdown content](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite) which powers the [Demo](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/)

3. Build your site by running the `hugo` command. Then [host it for free using Github Pages](https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/) or Netlify (refer to the first installation method). Alternatively, copy the generated `public/` directory (by FTP, Rsync, etc.) to your production web server (such as a university's hosting service).

## Updating

Feel free to *star* the project on [Github](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/) to help keep track of updates and check out the [release notes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/updates) prior to updating your site.

Before updating the framework, it is recommended to make a backup of your entire website directory (or at least your `themes/academic` directory) and record your current version number.

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
