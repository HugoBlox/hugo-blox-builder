        # Welcome üëã

        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report.

        We use GitHub Issues for project management, **NOT for support**.

        üöë For **help** and **questions**, search if your question has already been asked on the community **[chat](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb)** and **[forum](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes/discussions)**, and if not, ask your question there instead.

        Bug reports also shouldn't be used for support requests about a specific problem in your site, only if the issue can be reproduced on a fresh Wowchemy template.

        Also, you can search and browse the extensive [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) **documentation**.

        For questions on _Blogdown_, please reach out to the [Blogdown community](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).

        Please fill out each section below. This info allows Wowchemy contributors to diagnose (and fix!) your issue as quickly as possible. Otherwise we might need to close the issue (e.g. when it's missing clear steps to reproduce).

        Also, please verify that your issue is present in the very latest `main` version.
