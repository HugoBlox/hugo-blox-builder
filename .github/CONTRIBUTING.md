### For technical contributions

## 🛠️ Development Setup

> **No Go experience needed!** Most contributions only require basic HTML/CSS knowledge.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Node.js** (for Tailwind CSS v4)

   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux (using Homebrew)
   brew install node

   # Windows (download from nodejs.org)
   # Or use WSL2 for a Linux environment
   ```

2. **Install pnpm** (our package manager)

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

3. **Install Hugo Extended** (latest version)

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install hugo

   # Windows (using Chocolatey)
   choco install hugo-extended

   # Linux
   snap install hugo --channel=extended
   ```

### Getting Started

1. **Fork & Clone**

   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub first, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/hugo-blox-builder.git
   cd hugo-blox-builder
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **View a Starter Site**

   ```bash
   # View the academic-cv starter (most popular)
   ./scripts/view-starter-dev.sh academic-cv

   # Site opens at http://localhost:8081
   ```

That's it! You're ready to contribute. 🎉

### Repository structure

```
hugo-blox-builder/
├── modules/
│   └── blox-tailwind/        # Main theme module
│       ├── layouts/          # HTML templates (easy to edit!)
│       ├── assets/css/       # Tailwind CSS v4 styles
│       └── i18n/            # Translations (help translate!)
├── starters/

│   └── documentation/      # Docs template
└── scripts/                # Helper scripts
```

**Note**: To contribute an improvement to a starter template, make your changes to the relevant template within the `starters/` folder. **Do not submit PRs to the dedicated template repositories as they are read-only (changes are automatically propagated there from this mono-repository).**

#### What are some good issues to contribute to?

If you're a developer looking to contribute, but you're not sure where to begin, check out the [help wanted](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder/labels/help%20wanted) label on Github, which contains issues which need some love.

#### How can I propose an improvement?

If you have a straightforward bug fix or improvement, feel free to contribute it in a [Pull Request](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder/pulls) for the community to review.

If you have an idea for a new feature, please start by [searching the issues](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder/issues) to check that the feature has not already been suggested and then suggest it by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder/issues/new/choose), as adding new features to Hugo Blox first requires some analysis around the design and spec.

Please be mindful of the project [scope](#scope).

### Contribute Blox

[Create and publish your own blox](https://github.com/HugoBlox/create-blox)

### Contribute a shortcode

[Create and publish your own shortcode](https://github.com/HugoBlox/create-shortcode)

### Contribute a language pack

To contribute a **new language pack** or an improvement to a language pack, refer to the [language pack guide](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/language/#create-or-modify-a-language-pack). Once created, [fork Hugo Blox Builder](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder), place your language pack in `modules/blox-tailwind/i18n/`, add the language metadata to `modules/blox-tailwind/data/languages.yaml`, and open a Pull Request on Github with these two files.

### Contribute a theme pack

[View the guide](https://docs.hugoblox.com/getting-started/customize/#appearance) to contributing a color and font theme pack.

### Contribute a template

Consider duplicating a bare-bones template, such as the [Link In Bio](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder/tree/main/starters/link-in-bio) folder, and building up your own template using the Hugo Blox. Reach out on the **Contributing** channel in Discord to submit your template.

### Contribute to the Publication importer

To contribute to **Hugo Academic CLI**, the automatic publication and blog post importer, refer to [its dedicated Github repository](https://github.com/GetRD/academic-file-converter) and Issue queue.

## 🤝 Getting Help

### Where to Ask Questions

- **🗣️ Discord**: Real-time chat in [#contributing channel](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb)
- **💬 Discussions**: Async help in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder/discussions)
- **🐛 Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests

### Tips for Getting Quick Help

1. **Share your environment**: Hugo version, HugoBlox version in `go.mod`, OS, browser
2. **Provide minimal reproduction**: Smallest example showing the issue
3. **Check existing issues**: Your question might be answered
4. **Be specific**: "Publications not showing" → "BibTeX import fails with DOI links"

## Best practices

To create a consistent experience for all contributors and help prevent bugs, we have some best practices.

### Conventional Commits Specification

Please follow the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

For example:

- new feature: `feat: add the X parameter`
- bug fix: `fix: typo in implementation of X parameter`
- performance: `perf: speed up init by pre-warming only pages`
- refactor: `refactor: simplify citation logic`
- docs: `docs: document the X parameter`
- style: `style: change font color from black to blue`
- build-related: `chore: rebuild JS assets`

### Linting and formatting

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format
```

## Scope

Please be _mindful_ that although we encourage feature requests, we cannot expand the scope of the project in every possible direction. There will be feature requests that don't make the roadmap.

Every feature requires effort not just to analyse the requirements, design it, implement it, test it, document it, merge it, write release notes for it, and release it, but also to continuously support users with it and maintain it (fixing and refactoring the feature as the project and its dependencies evolve).

The more regular active volunteers (rather than one-off contributors) we have supporting users and maintaining the project, the more feasible it becomes to expand the scope of the project.

The project's scope also has to be constrained so that it doesn't get too complex and unwieldy, from an architectural perspective, a testing perspective, and from a usability perspective.

Plugins (widgets, shortcodes, theme packs, language packs, and third-party JavaScript integrations) as well as templates allow the community to add major features without needing to contribute to Hugo Blox itself.

## 📋 Contribution Checklist

Before submitting a PR:

- [ ] **Test locally**: Run `./scripts/view-starter-dev.sh academic-cv`
- [ ] **Check formatting**: Run `pnpm run lint:js` (if you edited JS)
- [ ] **Update docs**: If adding features, document them in the code and in the PR
- [ ] **Add examples**: Show how to use new features
- [ ] **Write clear commit messages**: Help future contributors understand changes

## 🙏 Thank You!

Every contribution matters — whether it's fixing a typo, adding a translation, or building a new feature. You're helping thousands of researchers share their work with the world.

**Welcome to the Hugo Blox community!** 🎉
