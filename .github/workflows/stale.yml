          stale-issue-message: |
            This issue is stale because it has not had any recent activity. The resources of the project maintainers are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

            If this is a **bug** and you can still reproduce this error on the <code>main</code> branch, consider contributing a Pull Request with a fix.

            If this is a **feature request**, and you feel that it is still relevant and valuable, consider contributing a Pull Request for review.

            This issue will automatically close soon if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.
          stale-pr-message: |
            This PR is stale because it has not had any recent activity. The resources of the project maintainers are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

            If you feel that the PR is still relevant in the latest release, consider making the PR easier to review and finding developers to help review the PR.

            Please be _mindful_ that although we encourage PRs, we cannot expand the scope of the project in every possible direction. There will be requests that don't make the roadmap.

            This PR will automatically close soon if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.
