For **help** and **questions** please join our **[community chat](https://spectrum.chat/academic)** or use the **[forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/c/themes)** 🚑.

Please **_do not_** raise an issue on GitHub.

Also, you can search and browse the extensive [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) **documentation**.

For questions on _Blogdown_, please reach out to the [Blogdown community](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).

Issues which are not bug reports or feature requests will be closed.

## Why not GitHub?

GitHub is our project management tool, it's the place where our volunteers contribute. We use the issue list to keep track of bugs and new features that we are working on. We do this openly for transparency.

With the chat and forum, you can leverage the knowledge of our wider community to get help with any problems you are having with Academic. Please keep in mind that Academic is Free Open Source Software (FOSS), and free support is provided by the goodwill of our wonderful community members.
