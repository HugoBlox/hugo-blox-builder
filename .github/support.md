Please **_do not_** raise an issue on GitHub.

## Why not GitHub?

GitHub is our project management tool, it's the place where our volunteers contribute. We use the issue list to keep track of bugs and new features that we are working on. We do this openly for transparency.

With the chat and forum, you can leverage the knowledge of our wider community to get help with any problems you are having with Wowchemy. Please keep in mind that Wowchemy is Free Open Source Software (FOSS), and free support is provided by the goodwill of our wonderful community members.
