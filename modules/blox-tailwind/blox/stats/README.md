- **Delay Timing**: 150ms between items
- **Threshold**: Triggers 100px before entering viewport

### Hover Effects

- **Color Transitions**: Text color changes
- **Background Glow**: Subtle gradient overlay
- **Shadow Enhancement**: Deeper shadows on hover

## Configuration Options

### Content Fields
- **title**: Optional section heading
- **text**: Optional description
- **items**: Array of statistics
  - `statistic`: Number or value (required)
  - `description`: What the number represents (required)
  - `icon`: Icon identifier (optional)
  - `sub_metric`: Additional context (optional)

### Design Options
- **layout**: Visual layout
  - `cards`: Individual cards (default)
  - `compact`: Single divided card
  - `minimal`: Clean typography focus

## Icon Guidelines

### Recommended Icons for Common Stats

**Publications/Research:**
- `hero/document-text` - Publications
- `hero/beaker` - Research projects
- `hero/light-bulb` - Discoveries/innovations
- `hero/trophy` - Awards/recognition

**People/Team:**
- `hero/user-group` - Team members
- `hero/academic-cap` - Students/graduates
- `hero/users` - Community/users
- `hero/heart` - Satisfaction ratings

**Financial/Business:**
- `hero/currency-dollar` - Funding/revenue
- `hero/banknotes` - Investments
- `hero/chart-bar` - Growth metrics
- `hero/building-office` - Locations

**Technology/Digital:**
- `hero/cpu-chip` - Computing power
- `hero/globe-alt` - Global reach
- `hero/chart-line` - Performance metrics
- `hero/server` - Infrastructure

## Performance Notes

### JavaScript Usage
Minimal JavaScript for:
- Intersection Observer (viewport detection)
- Counter animation (number progression)
- Modern browser APIs only

### CSS Animations
- Hardware accelerated transforms
- Optimized for 60fps
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Fallbacks for older browsers

### Image Optimization
- SVG icons preferred (scalable, fast)
- WebP fallbacks for raster images
- Lazy loading for non-critical images

## Best Practices

1. **Number Selection**: Choose impactful, verifiable metrics
2. **Descriptions**: Keep concise but descriptive
3. **Icons**: Match icons to metric meaning
4. **Sub-metrics**: Add credibility with specific details
5. **Layout**: Choose based on number of items (2-4: cards, 5+: compact)
6. **Consistency**: Use similar metric types (all percentages, all counts)
7. **Context**: Include timeframes where relevant

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Animations
Override animation timing:
```css
.stats-item {
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-delay: 0.2s;
}
```

### Custom Counters
For complex number formatting:
```yaml
statistic: "99.9%"  # Will animate 0 â†’ 99
statistic: "$2.5M"  # Will animate 0 â†’ 2.5
statistic: "1st"    # Will animate 0 â†’ 1
```

### Accessibility
- Numbers are announced by screen readers
- Animations respect motion preferences
- High contrast maintained
- Keyboard navigation supported

The enhanced Stats block creates visual impact while maintaining professional credibility - essential for research lab websites targeting academic and industry audiences.
