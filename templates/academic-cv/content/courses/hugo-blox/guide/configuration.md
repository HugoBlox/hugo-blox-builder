  sidebar:
    - name: "Need help?"
      params:
        type: separator
      weight: 1
    - name: "A page"
      pageRef: "/page-filename-here"
      weight: 2
    - name: "An external link â†—"
      url: "https://hugoblox.com"
      weight: 3
```

## Right Sidebar

A table of contents is automatically generated from the headings your Markdown file.

It can optionally be disabled by setting `toc: false` in the front matter of a page:
